# Dokuthon
 A python sodoku generator and solver using two implementations. This solver uses the libraries dokusan, np and random to generate a python board and solves it with backtracking. Dokusan has alreay implemented functions to print and solve sodoku puzzles so I wanted to see if I could create my own version.
